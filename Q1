Question 1 
Ratan is a crazy rich person. And he is blessed with luck, so he always made the best profit possible with the shares he bought. That means he bought a share at a low price and sold it at a high price to maximize his profit. Now you are an income tax officer and you need to calculate the profit he made with the given values of stock prices each day. You have to calculate only the maximum profit Ratan earned.

  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int n = sc.nextInt();
  int[] price = new int[n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
  price[i] = sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println(max(price));
}
public static int max(int[] price) {
if (price.length < 2)
return 0;
int min= price[0];
int max1= 0;
for (int i = 1; i < price.length; i++) {
  if (price[i]<min)
  min= price[i];
  else
  max1=Math.max(max1,price[i]-min);
  }
return max1;
 }
}
